## My process

Made a HTML first, then tried to make styling similar to example. At the end made basic logic to the pricing system.

### Built with

- HTML 5
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

Mostly just re-train everything, but custom slider was new to me.

### Continued development

Keep learn JS and make more complex projects.
